# Superstore-Tableau
Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client wants to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centers will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.

The replenishment of the majority of raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centers is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:

Historical data of demand for a product-center combination
Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price and discount
Information for fulfillment centers like center area, city information, etc.
You can download the dataset from here.

You need to come up with a story in Tableau that talks about the level of demand in each center. This analysis needs to be granular enough to include product information as well (category, price, etc.). The client wants an end-to-end report to understand which fulfillment areas are doing well and which aren't. You can also talk about center-meal combinations to add nuance to your final submission.
